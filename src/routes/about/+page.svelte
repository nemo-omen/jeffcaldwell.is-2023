<article>
<p>
I'm a digital journalist who's in the last year of getting a computer science degree in San Angelo, Texas. I love making websites and writing and I have a personal focus on making sites that are accessible, fast and great looking.

I grew upo in San Angelo but spent the greater part of my adulthood living in Brooklyn, NY. I moved back in 2018 to pursue my degree.
